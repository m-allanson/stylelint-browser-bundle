# Stylelint browser bundle

Bundle stylelint and its dependencies into a single file.

# Getting started

Add `dist/stylelint-browser-bundle.js` to a page's `script` tag.

# How it works

Webpack is used to bundle stylelint and its dependencies into a single file. The build config ignores or replaces unnecessary and incompatible dependencies.
